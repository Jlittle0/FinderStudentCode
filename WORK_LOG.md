| October 28 | 2:00-2:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                    Ideated with table and classmates about how to approach this problem, and spent the 30 minutes we had doing so. Came up with creating a relatively small array compared to a trillion (maybe a few million elements at most) and then adding an array or arraylist to each of them to either double hash or keep a running list of values to iterate through to find the one we want. |
| October 30 | 12:35-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                        For the first half of class, I continued exploring ways I could solve this problem, talking with other classmates etc. on our ideas and of course working as a whole class to share. After those initial 30 minutes, I began trying to read in all the lines from the csv file, which didn't exactly work but I did learn/'remember the methods I would eventually need to do so. |
| November 1 | 7:30-8:10am  | Was struggling quite a bit to actually try to read in all the data, because I didn't know that running the method readLine() kept causing it to skip over the past indicies because each time it was run it went to the next line. Because of that, spent a lot of time just trying to figure that out, but after that was done, quickly got my whole array working with all the keys entered and then created the method so that quereies could work. At this point, I now just need to start accounting for collisions that occur and whenever the arrayList has a size larger than 1. |

While ideating, came up with the idea to append the sum of all the digits in the converted key to the end of the string value stored at that index so that whenever I iterate through the arraylist, I can check the final digits to see whether or not they match with my desired key. |
