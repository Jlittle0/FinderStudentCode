| April 5    |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| October 28 | 2:00-2:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Ideated with table and classmates about how to approach this problem, and spent the 30 minutes we had doing so. Came up with creating a relatively small array compared to a trillion (maybe a few million elements at most) and then adding an array or arraylist to each of them to either double hash or keep a running list of values to iterate through to find the one we want. |
| October 30 | 12:35-1:45pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              For the first half of class, I continued exploring ways I could solve this problem, talking with other classmates etc. on our ideas and of course working as a whole class to share. After those initial 30 minutes, I began trying to read in all the lines from the csv file, which didn't exactly work but I did learn/'remember the methods I would eventually need to do so. |
| November 1 | 7:30-8:10am  |                       Was struggling quite a bit to actually try to read in all the data, because I didn't know that running the method readLine() kept causing it to skip over the past indicies because each time it was run it went to the next line. Because of that, spent a lot of time just trying to figure that out, but after that was done, quickly got my whole array working with all the keys entered and then created the method so that quereies could work. At this point, I now just need to start accounting for collisions that occur and whenever the arrayList has a size larger than 1. |
| November 1 | 8:10-8:40am  |                                                                                                                                    Experimented with ways to solve the issue of not knowing which element in the arraylist was associated with my key other than by creating a new class that holds a key and a value. While ideating, came up with the idea to append the sum of all the digits in the converted key to the end of the string value stored at that index so that whenever I iterate through the arraylist, I can check the final digits to see whether or not they match with my desired key. |
| November 5 |  8:45-9:55   |                                                                                                                                                                       Worked on new method during class, where I use a linear-probing hashmap to find the desired values. Worked for the first couple test cases but for the harder ones, the keys weren't matching correctly and I couldn't find out what was going wrong. In this time I created the Hashmap and input all the elements in the table as well as created the query function that mirrored the same process used in the creation of the table. |
| November 7 | 8:00-9:00pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Fixed the problems I was having which were the result of me completely messing up my re-hashing in the table and how elements were added to the map etc. After this, all the test cases now work as intended but the longest case takes 30+ seconds instead of the 2 it should be taking. Not sure what is causing this but will try to fix it later and in the morning. |
| November 8 | 8:00-8:45am  | Tried to figure out what was happening with my algorithm but nothing was working. Met with Mr. Blick to find out and realized that I completely forgot about the fact that my array_size shouldn't be a factor of a potential multiple of the radix and the two were just super incompatible with each other. Decided to find a new number that was prime to start with initially that would help with this issue and algorithm immediately dropped to 1.5s instead of 30. Went from the worst case basically where everything was being added in a linear manner to what was intended through linear-probing. |
